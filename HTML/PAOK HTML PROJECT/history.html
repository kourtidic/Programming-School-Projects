                PAOK FC is the oldest department of the major multi-sport club AC P.A.O.K., which is closely linked with Hermes Sports Club, that was formed in 1875 by the Greek community of Pera, a district of Istanbul (Constantinople).

                The football club was founded in April 1926 by Constantinopolitan refugees who fled to Thessaloniki after the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War. PAOK's policy was to be open to every citizen of Thessaloniki, leading to a minor rivalry with Enosis Konstantinoupoliton Thessalonikis (A.E.K.), the other Constantinopolitan club of the city, in which only refugees were allowed to play. Both clubs were founded by Enosis Konstantinoupoliton Thessalonikis (A.E.K.), a social and political organization. The original logo of PAOK was a horseshoe and a four-leaf clover.

                PAOK played their primary friendly match on 4 May 1926 at the stadium of Thermaikos, defeating Megas Alexandros Thessaloniki 2–1. The first coach of the club was Kostas Andreadis who spent five years on the team's bench without demanding payment. Their first captain was Michalis Ventourelis.

                In the 1926–1927 season, PAOK participated in the 2nd tier of the Macedonia Football Clubs Association local Macedonia championship. PAOK's historic inaugural official match was a 3–1 win against Nea Genea Kalamaria on 12 December 1926. Despite finishing at the top of the 2nd division, PAOK were forced by the organizing committee to play against the 1st division teams and defeat all of them in order to get promoted. Eventually, they defeated all four teams: Thermaikos 4–1, Aris 2–1, Atlas 2–0 (w/o), and Iraklis 1–0. In 1927–1928, PAOK participated for the first time in the 1st tier of Ε.Π.Σ.Μ.

                The first professional contract was signed by the club on 5 September 1928. The contract stipulated that the French footballer Raymond Etienne (of Jewish descent from Pera Club) would be paid 4,000 drachmas per month. The contract was signed by Dr. Meletiou, the PAOK chairman, and Mr. Sakellaropoulos, the Hon. Secretary.

                In March 1929, Enosis Konstantinoupoliton Thessalonikis (A.E.K.) was disbanded as a sports club and their members joined PAOK. PAOK thereupon changed their emblem, adopting the Double-headed eagle, as a symbol of the club's Byzantine/Constantinopolitan heritage, which was also the emblem of the maternal organization Enosis Konstantinoupoliton Thessalonikis (A.E.K.). PAOK also got possession of A.E.K.'s facilities located around Syntrivani, next to the Children's Heritage Foundation, where today stands the Faculty of Theology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The same year PAOK and Enosis Konstantinoupoliton Thessalonikis (A.E.K.) wanted to expand the football ground, but they faced problems with the underground flow of the river. Finally, after technical works, the keystone was put on 12 December 1930.

                In the 1930–1931 season, PAOK made their debut in the Panhellenic Championship, playing their first match on 1 February 1931 against Olympiacos at Piraeus, where they were defeated by 3–1, and ended the season in 5th place. The first foreign coach in the team's history was Austrian Rudolf Gasner, who served at PAOK in 1931–1932. On 5 June 1932, the Syntrivani Stadium was inaugurated with PAOK's 3–2 victory over Iraklis. Syntrivani was their home ground for 27 years.

                In 1937, PAOK won their first regional title, the Macedonia championship, and participated in the Panhellenic Championship, finishing 2nd. The 1937 team included: Sotiriadis, Vatikis, Goulios, Kontopoulos, Bostantzoglou, Panidis, Glaros, Kritas, Ioannidis, Kalogiannis, Koukoulas, Kosmidis, Apostolou, Vafiadis, Vasiliadis, Anastasiadis, Moschidis, Tzakatzoglou, Zakapidas.
